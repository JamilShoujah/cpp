Exercise 3: Abstraction - Employee Management System
Problem:

Create an abstract class Employee with a pure virtual method calculateSalary().

Create two derived classes: FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.

FullTimeEmployee should have a fixed salary, while PartTimeEmployee should be paid by the hour.

Demonstrate polymorphism by calculating salaries for both types of employees.
