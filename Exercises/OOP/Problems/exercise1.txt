Exercise 1: Class Inheritance - Creating a Shape Hierarchy
Problem:

Create a base class Shape that has a function area() and perimeter(). These will be pure virtual functions, making Shape an abstract class.

Create derived classes Rectangle and Circle, and implement the area() and perimeter() functions for each.

Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a Shape pointer array and calculating the area and perimeter of multiple shapes.
