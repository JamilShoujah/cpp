You are building a geometry system for a drawing application. Implement the following classes:

Base Class: Shape
Has a name attribute.

A constructor to set the name.

A virtual method area() that returns 0.

A virtual method display() that prints the shape name.

Derived Class: Rectangle
Has width and height.

Overload the area() method to return the area.

Overload the display() method to show dimensions.

Overload the + operator to add two rectangles (sum of width and height).

Overload a method named scale():

scale(int factor)

scale(double factor)

Derived Class: Circle
Has radius.

Override area() and display() as in Rectangle.
